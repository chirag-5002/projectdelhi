# Project Delhi

Project Delhi is a modern, responsive community collaboration platform designed to empower and coordinate volunteer initiatives across India's capital. Developed as an initiative of the **Naksh Foundation**, the platform facilitates the creation of community campaigns (cleanups, educational drives, relief distributions), manages volunteering registries, processes newsletter subscriptions, and hosts a structured manual donation reporting and verification system with automated 80G tax receipt issuance.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Proposal Campaign System
*   **Raise Proposals**: Registered users can submit detailed campaign proposals (cleanups, relief drives, cyber safety seminars) specify locations on an interactive Leaflet map, schedule event dates, and define volunteer requirements.
*   **Moderator Lifecycle**: Core moderators can review pending proposals, request revisions/clarifications, or approve them to go live.
*   **Real-time Notifications**: Automated email alerts update proposers on approval stages, moderator questions, and capacity achievements.

### 2. Volunteer Pool & Event Sign-ups
*   **Task Registrations**: Volunteers can sign up for specific, active campaigns. 
*   **General Volunteer Pool**: Users can register in a general volunteer registry, specifying preferred roles and localities.
*   **Admin Panel**: Core administrators can view registered volunteers, track activity metrics, and export data directly as CSV files.

### 3. Manual Donation Verification Flow (80G Tax Exemption)
*   **Pill-Tab Payment UI**: Sleek, above-the-fold interface allowing users to toggle between Google Pay (UPI QR Code) and Direct Bank Transfer (NEFT/IMPS) details.
*   **Report Transfer Form**: Nested inside the details card, enabling users to submit their transaction reference IDs.
*   **Immediate Acknowledgement**: Triggers an automated email to the donor confirming receipt of report details.
*   **Admin Approval**: Administrators verify transaction IDs, approving or rejecting submissions. Approved transfers trigger professional, automated PDF-friendly tax receipts via email.
